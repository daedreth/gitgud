# gitgud
An Open Source Discord Stress-testing Tool

# Current features
* Control a large amount of bot accounts to stress test anti-spam bots
* Dry-run mode to make sure all bots are connected to the server and can speak (run with -d)
* Alternate between multiple sent messages to avoid repeat message filters

# Planned features
* Variable delay between messages to avoid message speed filters
* Automatically join servers (NOTE: THIS WILL UNVERIFY YOUR ACCOUT)
* Automatically join/leave servers to rate limit role-based probation bots (again, see above)
